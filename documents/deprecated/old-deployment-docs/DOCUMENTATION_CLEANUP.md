# Documentation Cleanup Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-08 (Day 4)
**Action:** Consolidated documentation, archived outdated files, created unified status document

---

## ‚úÖ What Was Done

### 1. Created New Consolidated Status Document
- **[PROJECT_STATUS.md](PROJECT_STATUS.md)** - NEW primary status document
  - Current state (Day 4)
  - Strategic decisions from Day 3 convergence
  - Hybrid approach (Track 1 + Track 2)
  - Next steps with priority order
  - Success metrics and timeline
  - Lessons learned and decisions that changed

### 2. Updated README.md
- Refreshed overview to reflect Cook Card focus
- Updated feature list (Core features + Cook Card in progress)
- Revised roadmap with Week 4 context
- Added pointer to PROJECT_STATUS.md

### 3. Archived Outdated Documentation
Moved to `documents/archive/`:
- AI_RECIPE_GENERATION_STRATEGY.md (deprecated - using social import instead)
- ARCHITECTURE_ASSESSMENT.md (superseded by current ARCHITECTURE.md)
- CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md (historical reference)
- DAY2_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md (historical milestone)
- DAY2_DEVICE_TEST_PLAN.md (historical milestone)
- L1_VALIDATION_STATUS.md (superseded by current progress)
- MANUAL_DEVICE_TESTING_GUIDE.md (historical reference)
- RECEIPT_PARSING.md (superseded by current ARCHITECTURE.md)
- RECIPE_API_PRICING_2025.md (reference only - not using external APIs)
- SHARE_EXTENSION_LOGIC_FLOW.md (deprecated - using paste flow for IG/TikTok)
- SHARE_EXTENSION_SETUP.md (deprecated strategy)
- SHARE_EXTENSION_VALIDATION.md (deprecated strategy)

Created `documents/archive/README.md` to index archived files.

### 4. Retained Active Documentation
Root-level files (current and relevant):
- **PROJECT_STATUS.md** - Primary status document (NEW)
- **README.md** - Project overview (UPDATED)
- **COOKCARD_PRD_V1.md** - Cook Card product requirements
- **COOKCARD_SCHEMA_V1.md** - Cook Card data schema
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** - System architecture
- **L2_QUALITY_STUDY_GUIDE.md** - How to run YouTube quality study
- **CANONICAL_LINKING_GUIDE.md** - Ingredient canonical matching

## üìä Before vs After

### Before (18 root .md files)
```
AI_RECIPE_GENERATION_STRATEGY.md
ARCHITECTURE.md
ARCHITECTURE_ASSESSMENT.md
CANONICAL_LINKING_GUIDE.md
CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md
COOKCARD_PRD_V1.md
COOKCARD_SCHEMA_V1.md
DAY2_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md
DAY2_DEVICE_TEST_PLAN.md
L1_VALIDATION_STATUS.md
L2_QUALITY_STUDY_GUIDE.md
MANUAL_DEVICE_TESTING_GUIDE.md
README.md
RECEIPT_PARSING.md
RECIPE_API_PRICING_2025.md
SHARE_EXTENSION_LOGIC_FLOW.md
SHARE_EXTENSION_SETUP.md
SHARE_EXTENSION_VALIDATION.md
```

### After (7 root .md files)
```
ARCHITECTURE.md                  [active]
CANONICAL_LINKING_GUIDE.md       [active]
COOKCARD_PRD_V1.md               [active]
COOKCARD_SCHEMA_V1.md            [active]
L2_QUALITY_STUDY_GUIDE.md        [active]
PROJECT_STATUS.md                [NEW - primary status doc]
README.md                        [updated]
```

**Result:** 61% reduction in root-level documentation files, clearer hierarchy

## üéØ How to Use Documentation Now

### For New Team Members / Onboarding
1. **Start here:** [README.md](README.md) - High-level overview
2. **Then read:** [PROJECT_STATUS.md](PROJECT_STATUS.md) - Current state and strategy
3. **For details:** [COOKCARD_PRD_V1.md](COOKCARD_PRD_V1.md) - Product requirements

### For Daily Development Work
1. **Check status:** [PROJECT_STATUS.md](PROJECT_STATUS.md) - What's next?
2. **Reference architecture:** [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) - How things work
3. **Quality study:** [L2_QUALITY_STUDY_GUIDE.md](L2_QUALITY_STUDY_GUIDE.md) - Run validation

### For Historical Context
- See `documents/archive/README.md` for index of archived documentation
- Archived files explain past decisions and deprecated strategies

## üîë Key Decisions Documented in PROJECT_STATUS.md

1. **Hybrid Strategy**: Track 1 (user import) + Track 2 (pantry recommendations)
2. **YouTube Deep Links**: Test native app flow before embedded player
3. **Data-Driven Curation**: Measure conversion BEFORE investing 50+ hours in curation
4. **Solopreneur Economics**: $10-20K MRR target, not VC-scale growth
5. **Platform Limitations**: IG/TikTok use paste flow (native share blocked by custom dialogs)

---

## üìù Next Actions

From PROJECT_STATUS.md:
1. Get YouTube Data API v3 key (15 min)
2. Run L2 quality study (10 min)
3. Analyze results (30 min)
4. Update PROJECT_STATUS.md with L2 study results
5. Proceed to MVP implementation based on L2 pass rate

# Testing Traditional Recipe Extraction ‚úÖ

**Status:** Fixed and redeployed (October 17, 2025)
**Deployment:** Production ready

---

## üîß Issues Fixed

1. **Database Constraint Error** ‚úÖ
   - Problem: `platform` check constraint didn't include "traditional"
   - Fix: Updated constraints in `cook_cards` and `cook_card_ingress_events` tables
   - Migration: `fix_platform_constraints_for_traditional`

2. **URL Detection Logic** ‚úÖ
   - Problem: Naive detection could misclassify URLs
   - Fix: Implemented robust 4-tier detection system:
     - **Tier 1:** Video platforms (YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, etc.) ‚Üí always social
     - **Tier 2:** Known recipe sites (40+ sites) ‚Üí always traditional
     - **Tier 3:** URL pattern analysis (`/recipe/`, `/recipes/`) ‚Üí traditional
     - **Tier 4:** Default to social (conservative, prevents failures)

3. **Error Handling** ‚úÖ
   - Problem: Generic "non-2xx status code" error
   - Fix: Comprehensive logging at every stage
   - Added: Detailed error messages, request/response logging, CORS headers

## üß™ Testing Protocol

### Step 1: Test URL Detection

Open your React Native app and try these URLs to verify correct routing:

**Expected: Social Media Extraction (yt-dlp + Gemini)**
```
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
https://www.instagram.com/p/ABC123/
https://www.tiktok.com/@user/video/123
```

**Expected: Traditional Recipe Extraction (schema.org)**
```
https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1027194-chicken-meatballs-with-yogurt-sauce
https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/basically-roasted-chicken
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/8805/quick-and-easy-pizza-crust/
```

### Step 2: Check Console Logs

**For Traditional URLs, you should see:**
```
[isTraditionalRecipeUrl] Known recipe site detected: cooking.nytimes.com ‚Üí traditional extraction
[PasteLink] URL type: traditional | Platform: traditional
[TraditionalRecipeService] Ingesting recipe from: https://cooking.nytimes.com/...
[TraditionalRecipeService] User ID: ...
[TraditionalRecipeService] Household ID: ...
```

**For Social URLs, you should see:**
```
[isTraditionalRecipeUrl] Video platform detected: youtube.com ‚Üí social extraction
[PasteLink] URL type: social | Platform: youtube
```

### Step 3: Verify Extraction Success

**Traditional Recipe Success:**
```
[TraditionalRecipeService] Success! Cook Card ID: ...
[PasteLink] Traditional recipe extracted: Chicken Meatballs with Yogurt Sauce
```

**Expected CookCard Data:**
- Title: From schema.org `name`
- Description: From schema.org `description`
- Ingredients: Array of strings from `recipeIngredient`
- Prep time: From `prepTime` (ISO 8601)
- Cook time: From `cookTime` (ISO 8601)
- Servings: From `recipeYield`
- Instructions: From `recipeInstructions`
- Cost: $0.00 (FREE!)

### Step 4: Test Edge Cases

**1. URL with no schema.org markup:**
```
https://example.com/some-random-page
```
Expected: Error with helpful message:
> "This website does not support schema.org Recipe markup. Try a different recipe site like NYT Cooking, Bon App√©tit, or AllRecipes."

**2. Malformed URL:**
```
not-a-url
```
Expected: Validation error before Edge Function call

**3. YouTube recipe (video):**
```
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH__o17xHls
```
Expected: Routes to social extraction (NOT traditional)

**4. Instagram recipe post:**
```
https://www.instagram.com/p/ABC123/
```
Expected: Routes to social extraction (NOT traditional)

## üìä Monitoring & Validation

### 1. Check Database

After successful extraction, verify data:

```sql
-- Check latest traditional recipe
SELECT
  id,
  title,
  platform,
  platform_identifier,
  extraction_method,
  extraction_cost_cents,
  created_at
FROM cook_cards
WHERE platform = 'traditional'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- Check ingredients
SELECT
  ingredient_name,
  amount,
  unit,
  confidence,
  provenance
FROM cook_card_ingredients
WHERE cook_card_id = '<cook_card_id>'
ORDER BY sort_order;

-- Check telemetry
SELECT
  event_type,
  platform,
  metadata,
  created_at
FROM cook_card_ingress_events
WHERE platform = 'traditional'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### 2. Check Edge Function Logs

```bash
npx supabase functions logs ingest-traditional-recipe --tail
```

Look for:
- `[IngestTraditional] Request received:` - Confirms request arrives
- `[SchemaOrgParser] Found valid Recipe schema` - Confirms parsing
- `[IngestTraditional] Created cook_card:` - Confirms DB insert
- `[IngestTraditional] ‚úÖ Success!` - Confirms completion

### 3. Verify Cost Tracking

```sql
-- Traditional recipes should all be $0.00
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_recipes,
  SUM(extraction_cost_cents) as total_cost_cents,
  AVG(extraction_confidence) as avg_confidence
FROM cook_cards
WHERE platform = 'traditional'
AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';

-- Should return: total_cost_cents = 0
```

---

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Error: "platform check constraint"
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed
**If still occurring:** Run migration again:
```sql
ALTER TABLE cook_cards DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS cook_cards_platform_check;
ALTER TABLE cook_cards ADD CONSTRAINT cook_cards_platform_check
  CHECK (platform = ANY (ARRAY['youtube'::text, 'instagram'::text, 'tiktok'::text, 'xiaohongshu'::text, 'facebook'::text, 'traditional'::text, 'web'::text, 'unknown'::text]));
```

### Error: "Edge Function returned a non-2xx status code"
**Check:**
1. Console logs for detailed error message
2. Edge Function logs: `npx supabase functions logs ingest-traditional-recipe`
3. Network tab for actual HTTP status code

**Common causes:**
- No schema.org markup on page ‚Üí 422 error (expected)
- Invalid URL format ‚Üí 400 error (validation)
- Database constraint violation ‚Üí 500 error (bug)

### Error: "Could not extract recipe"
**Possible reasons:**
1. Website doesn't use schema.org (expected)
2. Website blocks scraping (403/401)
3. Malformed schema.org JSON (parsing error)

**Solution:** Try a different recipe website from the known-good list:
- cooking.nytimes.com
- bonappetit.com
- allrecipes.com
- seriouseats.com

### Wrong Extraction Method Used
**Symptom:** Traditional URL goes to social extraction (or vice versa)

**Debug:**
```javascript
// Check console logs
[isTraditionalRecipeUrl] Video platform detected: ... ‚Üí social extraction
[isTraditionalRecipeUrl] Known recipe site detected: ... ‚Üí traditional extraction
```

**Fix:** Update `traditionalRecipeSites` array in `traditionalRecipeService.ts` if site is not recognized

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

**Phase 1 is working correctly if:**

1. ‚úÖ Traditional recipe URLs route to `ingest-traditional-recipe` Edge Function
2. ‚úÖ Social media URLs route to `extract-cook-card` Edge Function
3. ‚úÖ NYT Cooking recipe extracts successfully with $0.00 cost
4. ‚úÖ Ingredients are parsed (even if basic regex parsing)
5. ‚úÖ CookCard is saved to database with platform='traditional'
6. ‚úÖ Telemetry events are logged without constraint errors
7. ‚úÖ User can view extracted recipe in CookCardScreen
8. ‚úÖ No mixed-mode: URL is clearly traditional OR social, never both

---

## üéØ Known Limitations

These are **expected** and will be fixed in Phase 2:

1. **Basic ingredient parsing:** Using simple regex (75% accuracy)
   - Some ingredients may not parse correctly
   - Amount/unit extraction may fail for complex formats
   - Phase 2 will use `recipe-ingredient-parser-v3` library

2. **No canonical item matching:** All ingredients have `canonical_item_id = null`
   - Can't match to pantry items yet
   - Phase 2 will add fuzzy matching

3. **No ingredient validation:** Low-confidence ingredients are still saved
   - Phase 2 will add confidence scoring

4. **Limited error recovery:** If schema.org parsing fails, extraction fails
   - No fallback to web scraping
   - This is intentional (fail-closed)

## üìù Test URLs (Verified Working)

Copy these into your app for testing:

**Traditional Recipe Sites:**
```
https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1023265-classic-roast-chicken
https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/basically-roasted-chicken
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/8805/quick-and-easy-pizza-crust/
https://www.seriouseats.com/the-food-lab-ultimate-chocolate-chip-cookies-recipe
https://www.food52.com/recipes/85388-best-basic-tomato-sauce-recipe
```

**Social Media (for comparison):**
```
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH__o17xHls
https://www.instagram.com/reel/ABC123/
https://www.tiktok.com/@user/video/123
```

## üîÑ Next Steps After Testing

Once you confirm Phase 1 is working:

1. **Phase 2:** Improve ingredient parsing (85%+ accuracy)
2. **Phase 3:** Add canonical item matching
3. **Phase 4:** Build hybrid recommendation UI
4. **Phase 5:** Add meal history tracking

### L2 Quality Study Results (Completed 2025-10-08)

**Test Setup:**
- 20 diverse recipe videos from YouTube search (sorted by view count)
- Categories: quick meals, baking, healthy, dinner, breakfast
- Threshold: ≥5 ingredients + ≥0.70 avg confidence

**Results:**
- **Pass Rate: 0%** (0/20 videos met threshold)
- 50% (10/20) videos had empty/minimal descriptions (Shorts/viral content)
- 15% (3/20) videos had parseable ingredients but <5 count
- Best performers: 4 ingredients @ 0.89 confidence

**Critical Finding:**
YouTube search results (sorted by popularity) favor short-form viral content with minimal descriptions. L2 regex extraction fails for this content type.

**Decision:** Use L3 LLM (Gemini Flash) for **both** Track 1 and Track 2.

**Updated Cost Structure:**
- Track 1 (social import): $0.01-0.02/save (unchanged)
- Track 2 (YouTube search): $0.01-0.02/save (changed from $0.00)
- Combined average: ~$0.015/save (within budget)

**Note:** Traditional recipe channels (Tasty, Bon Appétit) may have better descriptions, but for real-time YouTube search UX, we'll encounter mostly short-form content.

### Known Gaps (Optional Features)
- ⏸️ **Add to Shopping List Logic** - UI exists, implementing next
- ⏸️ **Cost Estimates** - Deferred (not critical for MVP)
- ⏸️ **Recipe Collection View** - Show saved Cook Cards (future enhancement)

### Blockers
- ✅ None - Stage 1 MVP is production-ready

---

## 🚀 Strategic Decisions (Day 3 Convergence)

### Core Strategy: Hybrid Approach

**Track 1: User-Initiated Import** (Social → Pantry)
- User shares TikTok/IG/YouTube video → LLM extracts ingredients
- Cost: $0.01-0.02/save (Gemini Flash)
- Use case: "I found this recipe online, can I make it?"

**Track 2: Pantry-Driven Recommendations** (Pantry → Social)
- Show YouTube videos matching pantry items + expiring ingredients
- Cost: $0.01-0.02/save (Gemini Flash - L2 regex failed at 0% pass rate)
- Use case: "What can I cook with what I have?"

**Cost Impact:**
- Original plan: 80% Track 2 @ $0.00 + 20% Track 1 @ $0.015 = $0.003/save average
- Updated plan: 100% @ $0.015/save = $0.015/save average
- Still within $0.02/save target, enables both tracks to work reliably

### Key Decisions

#### 1. YouTube Deep Links (NOT Embedded Player Initially)
**Rationale:**
- Test deep links first (`youtube://...` or web fallback)
- Measure if users want in-app preview vs native app experience
- Add embedded player later IF data shows users request it

#### 2. Selective Curation (Data-Driven)
**Approach:**
- Ship MVP: Real-time YouTube search + pantry matching
- Measure conversion: `pantry_match_shown → video_opened → recipe_saved → cooked`
- **Gate:** Only curate IF save→cook >20% AND user demand data shows which recipes need curation
- Start with top 20 "hero recipes" if data justifies (not 100-500 upfront)

**Why:**
- Avoid 50+ hours of curation before validating PMF
- Let user behavior data drive which recipes to curate
- Community ratings can crowdsource quality (Phase 2)

#### 3. Solopreneur Economics (Not VC-Scale)
**Target:**
- 500-2K users = niche dominance
- $10-20K MRR = sustainable profitability
- Freemium: 5 saves/mo free, $10/mo Pro unlimited
- 10K users × 15% conversion × $10/mo = $15K MRR

#### 4. Ship Fast → Measure → Iterate
**Timeline:**
- Week 2: MVP shipped (YouTube deep links + pantry matching)
- Week 4: 100 users tested, conversion metrics measured
- Month 2: Conditional decisions based on data

### Stage 1-B: Quick Wins (Current Sprint)

**Goal:** Add high-value features that enhance user experience with minimal effort

**In Progress:**
1. ⏳ **Add to Shopping List** - Wire up existing UI buttons (1-2 hours)
   - Filter duplicates (items already in list)
   - Link to source recipe
   - Add telemetry event

**Planned:**
2. ⏸️ **Recipe Collection View** - Show saved Cook Cards (2-3 hours)
   - Query user's saved cook_cards
   - Display as grid with images
   - Tap to view Cook Card detail

3. ⏸️ **Cost Estimates** - Show estimated grocery cost (optional)
   - Calculate from purchase history
   - Display range ($8-12 at Costco)

**Success Criteria:**
- User can add missing ingredients to shopping list with one tap
- Saved Cook Cards are visible and accessible
- Conversion funnel improves (measured via telemetry)

---

### Stage 2: User-Curated Quality (Week 3-4)

**Goal:** Crowdsource video quality instead of manual curation

**What We're Adding:**
- 5-star rating system for videos
- "Was this helpful?" feedback
- Community-driven video ranking
- Surface top-rated videos first

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Let users vote on best videos
async function rateVideo(recipeId: string, videoId: string, rating: number) {
  await db.insert('video_ratings', {
    recipe_id: recipeId,
    video_id: videoId,
    user_id: currentUser.id,
    rating: rating, // 1-5 stars
  });
}

// Show community favorites first
const topVideos = await db.query(`
  SELECT video_id, AVG(rating) as avg_rating, COUNT(*) as vote_count
  FROM video_ratings
  WHERE recipe_id = $1
  GROUP BY video_id
  ORDER BY avg_rating DESC, vote_count DESC
  LIMIT 3
`, [recipeId]);
```

**Why This Approach:**
- Zero curation work (users do it)
- Network effects (more users = better data)
- Real usage data on what actually helps
- Scales infinitely

**Decision Gate:**
- IF community ratings improve conversion → Keep this approach
- IF not enough rating data → Proceed to Stage 3 selective curation

---

### Stage 3: Selective Curation (Month 2+ - Conditional)

**Goal:** Manually curate ONLY where data shows it matters

**Trigger:**
- Save→cook conversion >20% (validates pantry matching works)
- AND user demand data shows which recipes need curation

**Approach:**
```sql
-- Find recipes that need curation
SELECT recipe_id, recipe_name, search_count
FROM recipe_searches
WHERE search_count > 100  -- Popular
AND video_rating_count < 5  -- Not enough user ratings yet
ORDER BY search_count DESC
LIMIT 20
```

**Curate Top 20 Only:**
- 5-10 videos per recipe (tested personally)
- ~10 min per recipe (semi-automated with YouTube API filters)
- Total: 3-4 hours work
- Covers 30-40% of demand (Zipf's law)

**Curation Tools:**
```typescript
// Semi-automated curation
const topVideos = await youtubeAPI.search({
  q: `${recipeName} recipe`,
  type: 'video',
  order: 'viewCount', // Most popular
  videoDefinition: 'high',
  maxResults: 10,
});

// Filter by quality signals (automated)
const filtered = topVideos.filter(video => {
  return (
    video.viewCount > 100000 && // Popular
    video.description.includes('ingredient') && // Has ingredients
    video.channelTitle in KNOWN_GOOD_CREATORS && // Trusted
    video.duration > 180 && video.duration < 1200 // 3-20 min
  );
});

// YOU manually review top 3 (10 min per recipe)
```

**Why Conditional:**
- Don't waste 50+ hours before validating PMF
- Let data show which recipes need curation
- Start small (top 20), expand based on demand

---

### Stage 4: Embed Player (Month 3+ - Optional)

**Goal:** Add in-app preview IF data shows users want it

**Trigger:**
- User feedback requesting in-app preview
- OR A/B test shows embed improves conversion

**Implementation:**
- SFSafariViewController for web content (keeps cookies/auth)
- YouTube iframe API for embedded player (if needed)
- "Watch Preview" vs "Open in YouTube" choice

**Why Deferred:**
- Deep links test cheapest option first
- Native app has better UX (full-screen, YouTube features)
- Only add complexity if data justifies it

---

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Week 2 MVP Validation
- ✅ YouTube deep links functional
- ✅ Pantry matching displaying (X/Y ingredients, cost estimate)
- ✅ Share extension working (YouTube native, TikTok/IG paste)
- ✅ Track 1 LLM extraction <$0.02/save

### Week 4 Conversion Validation
- **Target:** >20% save→cook conversion
- **Measure:** 100 users × 7 days usage
- **If >20%:** Invest in selective curation (top 20 recipes)
- **If <10%:** Pivot strategy (focus Track 1 over Track 2)

### Month 2 Monetization
- Freemium paywall: 5 saves/mo free, $10/mo Pro
- Target: 10-15% conversion (industry standard)
- Economics: 1K users → 150 Pro → $1.5K MRR → validates pricing

## 🔄 Decisions That Changed

### What We Initially Thought (Day 1-2)
- ❌ Embedded WebView for social videos
- ❌ Curate 100-500 recipes upfront
- ❌ VC-scale growth (millions of users)
- ❌ Share extension works for all platforms

### What We Decided (Day 3-4)
- ✅ YouTube deep links (test first, add embed if needed)
- ✅ Data-driven curation (measure first, curate based on demand)
- ✅ Solopreneur profitability ($10-20K MRR sustainable)
- ✅ YouTube native share + TikTok/IG manual paste

### Why We Changed
- **Deep links vs embed:** Better UX to test native app flow first, users keep their cookies/auth
- **Curation timing:** 50+ hours investment before validating PMF is premature optimization
- **Scale target:** Profitability > growth; niche dominance > mass market
- **Share extension:** Instagram/TikTok use custom share dialogs that block third-party apps

---

## 🚧 Deferred Features (Phase 2+)

### Month 2 (After MVP Validation)
- Embedded YouTube player (if data shows users request it)
- TikTok/Instagram scraping (legal gray area, YouTube sufficient for MVP)
- User-curated video ratings (crowdsource quality)
- Advanced substitution engine (USDA nutritional similarity)

### Month 3+ (After Monetization)
- Household sharing (collaborative pantry + lists)
- Meal planning (multi-day scheduling)
- In-app checkout (Instacart/Amazon Fresh integration)
- Creator analytics dashboard (saves, cooks, reach)

---

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### Day 3 Strategic Pivot Insights
1. **Pantry matching is the differentiator** - not extraction quality
   - Kiwee competitor does LLM-first extraction (we have unique pantry data)
   - Our moat: Purchase history + expiry tracking + cost estimates

2. **Ship fast, measure, let data decide**
   - Avoid "premature optimization" (curation before PMF validation)
   - User behavior > assumptions (let metrics drive curation investment)

3. **Solopreneur lens requires different optimization**
   - Profitability > growth at all costs
   - Manageable scope > polished perfection
   - Speed to market > feature completeness

4. **Platform limitations shape strategy**
   - IG/TikTok share restrictions → paste flow is acceptable backup
   - YouTube API quota (10K/day) → sufficient for MVP scale
   - Deep links vs embed → test cheapest option first

## 📞 Questions to Resolve

### Resolved Decisions ✅
- [x] L2 quality study pass rate → **0% pass rate, using L3 LLM for both tracks**
- [x] Recipe recommendation screen → **Already built (ExploreRecipesScreenSupabase)**
- [x] Track 1 vs Track 2 priority → **Both completed simultaneously (Stage 1 MVP)**
- [x] YouTube deep links vs embed → **Deep links shipped, embed deferred**

### Open Questions
- [ ] Freemium paywall: 5 saves/mo or 10 saves/mo free tier?
- [ ] Share extension: Worth building iOS target or just paste flow for MVP?
- [ ] Which metrics dashboard: Grafana vs Supabase Studio vs custom?
- [ ] When to start Stage 2 (community ratings) vs Stage 1-B (quick wins)?

## ✅ Final Decisions Summary (Day 4 - Approved)

### What We're Doing
1. **YouTube Deep Links** (not embed) - Test native app flow first
2. **Real-Time Search** (not curation) - YouTube API search is good enough for MVP
3. **Staged Rollout** - 3 stages (MVP → User Ratings → Selective Curation)
4. **Data-Driven** - Measure conversion before investing in curation

### What We're NOT Doing (Yet)
- ❌ Embedded video player (defer until data shows users want it)
- ❌ Upfront curation (50+ hours before PMF validation is wasteful)
- ❌ TikTok/IG support in Stage 1 (YouTube-only for MVP)
- ❌ Advanced features (meal planning, household sharing, etc.)

### Why This Approach Wins
- **Speed:** Ship in 2 weeks vs 2 months
- **Risk Mitigation:** Validate core value prop (pantry matching) before polish
- **Solopreneur-Friendly:** Manageable scope, no 50-hour curation upfront
- **Data-Driven:** Let user behavior decide curation investment
- **Scalable:** Community ratings > manual curation long-term

### Key Insight from Day 3-4
> "Pantry matching is the differentiator, not extraction quality or video curation. Ship fast, measure conversion, let DATA decide where to invest next."

### Cost Structure (Updated 2025-10-08)
- **Track 2 (pantry → YouTube):** $0.01-0.02/save (Gemini Flash LLM - L2 regex failed)
- **Track 1 (social import):** $0.01-0.02/save (Gemini Flash LLM)
- **Both tracks:** Average $0.015/save (within $0.02 budget)

### Metrics Targets (Realistic)
- **Week 2:** MVP shipped, telemetry working
- **Week 4:** 100 users, >30% video_opened, >15% recipe_saved, >10% cooked
- **Month 2:** IF >20% save→cook, invest in top 20 hero recipes curation

---

**Next Action:** Build Stage 1 MVP (Phase 0 validation complete - proceed with L3 LLM for both tracks)

## üîç Backend Verification

SELECT
  u.email,
  p.display_name,
  h.name as household_name,
  hm.role
FROM auth.users u
JOIN profiles p ON u.id = p.id
JOIN household_members hm ON p.id = hm.user_id
JOIN households h ON hm.household_id = h.id
WHERE u.email = 'your@email.com';

-- Check inventory items
SELECT name, quantity, location, expiry_date, status
FROM pantry_items
WHERE household_id = (
  SELECT household_id FROM household_members
  WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
)
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check shopping list
SELECT si.name, si.checked, si.quantity
FROM shopping_list_items si
JOIN shopping_lists sl ON si.list_id = sl.id
WHERE sl.household_id = (
  SELECT household_id FROM household_members
  WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
);

-- Check receipt processing (mock)
SELECT
  r.store_name,
  r.receipt_date,
  r.total_amount_cents / 100.0 as total,
  COUNT(ri.id) as item_count
FROM receipts r
LEFT JOIN receipt_items ri ON r.id = ri.receipt_id
WHERE r.household_id = (
  SELECT household_id FROM household_members
  WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
)
GROUP BY r.id
ORDER BY r.created_at DESC;

-- System health check
WITH stats AS (
  SELECT
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pantry_items WHERE status = 'active') as items,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM shopping_list_items WHERE NOT checked) as shopping,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM receipts) as receipts,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM receipt_fix_queue WHERE NOT resolved) as fix_queue
